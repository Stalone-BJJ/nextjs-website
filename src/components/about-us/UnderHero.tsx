          STALONE BJJ IS A GREAT AND EXCITING WAY TO GET FIT
        </h2>
        <p className="text-sm my-4">
          Jiu-jitsu is a stimulating way of getting fit, it does not just
          physically challenge you but also mentally. Many of our students are
          people who got bored working out at a gym on a treadmill.

        <p className="text-sm my-4">
          Jiu-jitsu challenges them physically and mentally, it makes exercise
          fun! The major bonus of working out with Brazilian jiu-jitsu is that
          you also learn to defend yourself, a true win-win.
